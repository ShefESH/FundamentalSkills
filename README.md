Our series of lessons on several fundamental Cybersecurity skills

# Viewing the Lessons

You can either view these lessons on our website at [shefesh.com](https://shefesh.com/wiki/fundamental-skills) or in Obsidian by downloading the source.

## Installing Obsidian

### On Windows

Go to [the download page](https://obsidian.md/download)... and click Download

### On Kali

Go to [the download page](https://obsidian.md/download), and download the AppImage. Put it in any directory you want (I went with `~/Applications`)

You can either double click the file to run it, or run it with `/path/to/Obsidian-0.11.9.AppImage`

## Downloading the Vault

You will need to [download git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). This is a quick and easy process.

On Windows, open the Start Menu and search for 'Git Bash', then click it to open a bash terminal (or navigate to the folder you want to install the notes into, then right-click and press 'Git Bash Here'). On Unix, open a terminal of your choice.

In this Git Bash/terminal, type the following:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:ShefESH/FundamentalSkills.git
```

If you are uncomfortable using the command line, you can install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) instead.

Once you have cloned the repsitory, open Obsidian and click `Open folder as vault`, then select the `Cybersecurity-Notes` folder that was just created by Git. You're ready to go!
